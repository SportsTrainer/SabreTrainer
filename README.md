# SabreTrainer

The aim of this project is to put together a system that a sabre fencer can use to train their reflexes while unable to get to their local club due COVID 19 .

The system needs to be as simple as possible for any non-technical person to build and all materials need to be easy purchased and non expernsive.

With this in mind the solution given here uses the BBC micro:bit controller, a handful of crocodile clips and some aluminium foil or other conducting material.
